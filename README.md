# Spotify Song Rank Web

### Do you know Spotify Wrapped?
  Spotify Wrapped is a feature that Spotify offers to users every year. It shows the user's top artists, songs, genres and podcasts that litened to on Spotify throughout the year. User can also see how many minutes spending listening to Spotify and get personalized playlists based on the performance. 

### Motivation 
  However, you have to wait for a year to get the  Wrapped. To me, I will listen to different types of songs through different seasons. The analysis of the user performance would be messy. It will be nice if there is a website can show the top rank of my listening habbit every month or season!
